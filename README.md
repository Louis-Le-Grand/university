# University Notes and Files

These are my personal notes taken in lectures and other files related to my studies. Most of them are *LaTeX* files.

## My Setup for the Interested

+ I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension. It has an integrated `PDF` viewer which does not block the file of being overwritten while the file is opened.
+ For "proper" identation in my `.tex` files, I use [latexindent.pl](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexindent). But it has some problems, and I am to lazy to read the documentation and to make a `config` file.
+ I have written a custom package containing the preamble and custom commmands. Maybe you will see it here soon, as it is in another directory and *Git* does not track the file.
+ For version control, I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) in combination with *GitHub*.
